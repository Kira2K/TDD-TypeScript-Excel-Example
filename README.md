# Vue-TypeScript-Example

Hi everyone!

You are here to check out my TypeScript and Jest-testing skills, and i'm happy to show you my best. In this repo you can find 2 files: some TypeScript logic, which i find not very easy. but well done, and test file for a piece of this logic. You can't just run this files, because they are part of a bigger project and require a lot of other stuff, which was written by my colleagues, however you can read them and understand my skills by them.
